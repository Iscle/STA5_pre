STMicroelectronics DC Offset ADC driver for keys

The DC 0ffset ADC is able to trigger interrupt on the detection of a DC offset
in an analog signal. This feature can be used to use when the ADC channels are
connected to push buttons.


Required properties:

 - compatible:	   "st,dcoadc-keys"
 - reg:		   register base address and size of the DCO ADC
 - interrupts:     interrupt of the DCO ADC
 - clocks:	   clock of the DCO ADC
 - clock-names:    "apb_pclk"
 - st,adc-channel: sub-node property, describe the ADC channel on which the
		   key is connected
 - st,key-code :   sub-node property,the Linux key code that should be reported
		   as input event for this key

Optional properties:

 - "st,active-high":    sub-node property, to specify the GPIO is active high.
		        By default, keys are considered as active low
 - "st,adc-thresholds": sub-node property, to specify specific thresholds for
			the channel.
			1st cell: Upper Threshold
			2nd cell: Lower Threshold
			The default threshold are 0xffffffff and 0x175

Example:

dcoadc: adc-keys@481c0000 {
	compatible = "st,dcoadc-keys";
	reg = <0x481c0000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 80 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&pclksaradc>;
	clock-names = "apb_pclk";
	key1 {
		st,adc-channel = <3>;
		st,key-code = <106>; /* Right */
	};
	key2 {
		st,adc-channel = <4>;
		st,key-code = <105>; /* Left */
	};
};
