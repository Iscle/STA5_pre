* ST Microelectronics hardware cryptographic accelerators controller

This a configurable controller that host hardware cryptographic accelerators
found on some ST products.

* C3 Channel Controller (CCC)

Acts as a bus controller where cryptographic accelerators, namely channels, are
plugged in. These channels can be either MPAES HASH TRNG or PKA channels among
some others.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "st,ccc-v3.0".
- reg: "c3_base" should contain C3 registers location and length.
  "c3_program" should set DMA memory size for C3 microcode.
- interrupts: Should contain the interrupt line for the C3.
- interrupt-names: Should be "c3_irq".
- clocks: List of clocks for C3.
- clock-names: Should be "c3_hclk".
- enabled-dispatchers: u8 bit field to enable dispatcher one by one.

Example:
ccc: ccc@49000000 {
	compatible = "st,ccc-v3.0";
	reg = <0x49000000 0x6000>, <0x0 0x1000>;
	reg-names = "c3_base", "c3_program";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 68 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	interrupt-names = "c3_irq";
	clocks = <&hclkc3>;
	clock-names = "c3_hclk";
	enabled-dispatchers = /bits/ 8 <3>;
};
