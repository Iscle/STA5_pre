* ST Microelectronics hardware cryptographic accelerator

This is an AES hardware cryptographic accelerator found on some ST products.

* Micro-Programmable Advanced Encryption Standard (MPAES)

This hardware cryptographic accelerator is likely to be a channel of a C3
Channel Controller (see st,ccc.txt). Therefore this channel, as others do, must
be a child of a C3 device tree node.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "st,mpaes-v0.3".
- index: u8, from 0 to 15, where is located the channel in C3 hardware
  implementation.
- gp-key-slots: u16 bit field to depict available general purpose key slots.

Example:
mpaes@2 {
	compatible = "st,mpaes-v0.3";
	index = /bits/ 8 <2>;
	gp-key-slots = /bits/ 16 <0xfffc>;
};
