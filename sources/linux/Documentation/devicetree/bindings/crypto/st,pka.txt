* ST Microelectronics hardware cryptographic accelerator

This is a RSA hardware cryptographic accelerator found on some ST products.

* Public Key Accelerator (PKA)

This hardware cryptographic accelerator is likely to be a channel of a C3
Channel Controller (see st,ccc.txt). Therefore this channel, as others do, must
be a child of a C3 device tree node.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "st,pka-v0.7".
- index: u8, from 0 to 15, where is located the channel in C3 hardware
  implementation.
- countermeasure: power analysis countermeasure selection:
  0 for no countermeasure, 1 for SPA, 2 for DPA.

Example:

ccc: ccc@49000000 {
	status = "disabled";
	compatible = "st,ccc-v3.0";
	reg = <0x49000000 0x6000>, <0x0 0x2000>;
	reg-names = "c3_base", "c3_prog";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 68 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	interrupt-names = "c3_irq";
	clocks = <&srca7_clk STA_CLK_HC3>;
	clock-names = "c3_hclk";
	enabled-dispatchers = /bits/ 8 <1>;

	mpaes@1 {
		compatible = "st,mpaes-v0.3";
		index = /bits/ 8 <1>;
		gp-key-slots = /bits/ 16 <0xfffc>;
	};

	pka@2 {
		compatible = "st,pka-v0.7";
		index = /bits/ 8 <2>;
		countermeasure = <2>;
	};
};
