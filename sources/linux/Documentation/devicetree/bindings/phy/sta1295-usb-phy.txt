STMICROELECTRONICS STA1295 USB2 PHY

Required properties:
 - compatible: st,sta1295-usb2-phy
 - reg/reg-names: offset and length of the PHY registers
 (only needed if CDP feature enabled)  USB0 controller / USB1 controller
 - interrupts/interuppt-names:
 (only needed if CDP feature enabled) IRQ of USB0 and USB1 controller
 - st,misc_reg: offset and length of the MISC registers
 - #phy-cells: must be 0

Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties

Optional parameters
-st,usb0_mode: It offers the default mode selection for USB0, it can be
"DEVICE" or "HOST"
-st,usb1_mode: It offers the default mode selection for USB1, it can be
"DEVICE" or "HOST"
-st,usb0_cdp / usb0_regs : Enable the CDP feature for USB0 / indicate the
register base of USB0 controller as it's a common irq between USB controller
and usb phy
-st,usb1_cdp / usb1_regs : Enable the CDP feature for USB1 / indicate the
register base of USB1 controller as it's a common irq between USB controller
and usb phy
- st,xcver_trim0: tuning register setting for XCVER_TRIM0. Applied only when
supplied value is non-zero.
- st,xcver_trim1: tuning register setting for XCVER_TRIM1. Applied only when
supplied value is non-zero.

Example:
		usbphy: usb-phy@48440000 {
			compatible = "st,sta1295-usb2-phy";
			reg = <0x48440000 0x1000>,
			      <0x48400000 0x1000>;
			reg-names = "phy_regs", "usb0_regs";
			st, usb0_mode = DEVICE;
			st,usb0_cdp;
			usb0_regs = <0x48400000 0x1000>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 20 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
			interrupt-names = "usb0_irq";
			#phy-cells = <0>;
			clocks = <&pclkapbreg>;
			clock-names = "apbreg_clk";
		};
