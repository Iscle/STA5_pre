* ST Microelectronics Automotive Serial Quad Interface (SQI)

Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "st,sta-qspi"
  - reg : the first contains the register location and length,
          the second contains the memory mapping address and length
  - reg-names: Should contain the reg names "sqi-regs" and "sqi-mmap"
  - interrupts : Should contain the interrupt for the device
  - clocks : The clocks needed by the QuadSPI controller
  - clock-names : the name of the clocks

Example:

qspi0: sqi@50200000 {
	compatible = "st,sta-qspi";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0x50200000 0x200>,
	      <0x90000000 0x08000000>;
	reg-names = "sqi-regs", "sqi-mmap";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 6 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&sqiclk>;
	clock-names = "sqiclk";

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&sqi_default_mux>;

	flash0: serial-flash@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		spi-max-frequency = <133000000>;
	};
};
