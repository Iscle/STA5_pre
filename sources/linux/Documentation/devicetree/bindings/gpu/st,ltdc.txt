STMicroelectronics platforms with ltdc IP display controller.

- sta-display-subsystem: Master device for drm sub-components
  This device must be the parent of all the sub-components and is responsible of bind them.
  Required properties:
  - compatible: "st,display-subsystem"
  - ranges: to allow probing of subdevices

- clcd: lcd tft controller with composition capabilities, must be a child of sta-display-subsystem
  Required properties:
  - compatible: "st,ltdc"
  - interrupts : Display Controller interrupt numbers to the CPU.
  - reg: Physical base address of the ip registers and length of memory mapped region.
  - clocks: from common clock binding: handle hardware ip needed clocks, the number of clocks may depend of the soc type.
    See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
  - bus-width: width in bits of the display controller data bus
  - port: a port pointing to a remote display panel phandle

  Optional properties:
  - resets: resets to be used by the device. See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
