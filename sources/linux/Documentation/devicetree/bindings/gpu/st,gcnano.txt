Vivante gcnano GPU integration into STMicroelectronics platform

- gcnano: Vivante gcnano GPU ip
  Required properties:
  - compatible: "st,gcnano"
  - reg:
      - Physical base address of the ip registers and length of memory mapped
        region.
      - Reserved memory region (contiguous memory region) used by the Vivante
        software stack (minimum is 32MB, recommended is greater than 192MB).
  - reg-names: names of the mapped memory regions listed in regs property in
    the same order.
  - cloks: clocks to be managed by the driver
  - clock-names: names of the clocks listed by clocks property in the same order
  - interrupts: GPU interrupt for the 3D pipeline
  - interrupt-names: names of the interrupts listed in interrupts property in
    the same order.

Device node example:

/ {
	...

		gcnano@48F00000 {
			compatible = "st,gcnano";
			reg = <0x48F00000 0x800>,
			      <0xD4000000 0xC000000>,  /*192MB reserved memory*/
			reg-names = "iobase_3d",
				    "contig_baseaddr",
			clocks = <&hclkgfx>, <&aclkgfx>;
			clock-names = "clk_3d_ahb", "clk_3d_axi";
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 66 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			interrupt-names = "irq_3d";
		};


	...
};
