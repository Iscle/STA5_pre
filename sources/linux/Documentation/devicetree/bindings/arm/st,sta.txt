STMicroelectronics Automotive Platforms Device Tree Binding

The STMicroelectronics Automotive System On Chip family provides a cost
effective microprocessor solution for modern car radio and telematics systems,
with an embedded Digital Sound Processing subsystem, as well as an ARM
dual Cortex A7 processor. In addition, an ARM Cortex M3 controller is dedicated
for real-time CAN / Vehicle Interface Processing.

While STA1295 SoC embeds a powerful gpu as well as an efficient video decoder,
and is targeted for car radio systems, the STA1385 variant has neither
multimedia features nor Digital Sound Processing but embeds one additional
Cortex M0 dedicated to enhanced security features and is well suited for
telematics applications.

Each device tree must specify which STA SoC it uses,
using one of the following compatible strings:

  st,sta1295
  st,sta1195
  st,sta1385
  st,sta1275
