Remoteproc System Resource Manager
----------------------------------

The remoteproc SRM (System Resource Manager) handles resources allocated
to remote processors.
This makes it possible for remote proc to reserve and initialize system
resources for a peripheral assigned to a coprocessor.

The devices are grouped in a core node

Core
====
Required properties:
- compatible: should be "rproc-srm-core"

Dev (Generic)
===
Required properties:
- compatible: should be "rproc-srm-dev"

Optional properties:
- clocks: clocks required by the coprocessor
- clock-names: see clock-bindings.txt
- assigned-clocks: see clock-bindings.txt
- assigned-clock-parents: see clock-bindings.txt
- assigned-clock-rates: see clock-bindings.txt
- pinctrl-x: pins configurations required by the coprocessor
- pinctrl-names: see pinctrl-bindings.txt
- x-supply: power supplies required by the coprocessor

Example:
	system_resources {
		compatible = "rproc-srm-core";

		mmc0: sdhci@09060000 {
			compatible = "rproc-srm-dev";
			pinctrl-names = "default", "idle";
			pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_mmc0>;
			pinctrl-1 = <&pinctrl_mmc1>;
			clock-names = "mmc", "icn";
			clocks = <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_MMC_0>,
				 <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_RX_ICN_HVA>;
			vdda-supply = <&vdda>;
		};
	};

Dev (STA)
===
Required properties:
- compatible: should be "rproc-srm-sta-dev"
- st,shared-dev: phandle to any node that can be enabled/disabled
		 through SRM STA dev

Example:
	rproc {
		compatible = "st,sta-rproc";
		st,rp-name = "rproc-CSS";
		mboxes = <&mailbox 0>;
		system_resources {
			compatible = "rproc-srm-core";
			tuner_i2c {
				status = "okay";
				compatible = "rproc-srm-sta-dev";
				st,shared-dev = <&i2c1>;
			};
		};
	};
