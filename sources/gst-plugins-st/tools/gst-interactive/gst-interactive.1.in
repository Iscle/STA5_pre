.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
\fIgst\-interactive\fP is a tool that builds and runs basic
\fIGStreamer\fP pipelines and permit to make some action via terminal input?

In simple form, a PIPELINE\-DESCRIPTION is a list of
elements separated by exclamation marks (!). Properties may be appended to
elements, in the form \fIproperty=value\fR.

For a complete description of possible PIPELINE-DESCRIPTIONS see the section
\fIpipeline description\fR below or consult the GStreamer documentation.

Please note that \fIgst\-interactive\fP is primarily a debugging tool for
developers and users. You should not build applications on top of it. For
applications, use the gst_parse_launch() function of the GStreamer API as an
easy way to construct pipelines from pipeline descriptions.
